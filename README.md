This directory contains everything needed for
**Chapter 1 (Read a Children's Book)** in
[*Computational Thinking and Problem Solving (CTPS)*](https://profsmith89.github.io/ctps/ctps.html)
by Michael D. Smith.

`seuss.py`: an emtpy file that the reader can use as they
follow along in _CTPS_.

`seuss-2lines.py`: a script that attempts to read the first two
lines in the file `CatInTheHat.txt`.

`seuss-final.py`: the simplest solution to our first problem-to-be-solved.
It handles only one specific input file and doesn't close it.

`seuss-infinite.py`: turns the loop in `seuss-final.py` into
an infinite loop.

`anybook.py`: asks the user for the book to read and still doesn't
close the opened file.

`ale03ab.py`: code that goes with steps 1-3 of ALE #3, discussing
the right and wrong places to `close` the opened file.

`ale03c.py`: code that illustrates the use of a with-as statement.

`txts`: Directory containing plaintext stories (i.e., `[title].txt`)
and the output you should produce from the different solution scripts
you write (i.e., `[title]-soln*.py`).
