This directory contains everything needed for
Chapter 1 (i.e., Problem 1 in Act I, Scene I (Scripts)).

**Files for STUDENTS**

`seuss1.py`: the simplest solution to our first problem-to-be-solved.
It handles only one specific input file and doesn't close the file.

`seuss2.py`: asks the user for the book to read and still doesn't
close the opened file.

`ale03ab.py`: code that goes with parts (a) and (b) of ALE #3, discussing
the right and wrong places to `close` the opened file.

`ale03c.py`: code that illustrates the use of a with-as statement.

`txts`: Directory containing plaintext stories (i.e., `[title].txt`)
and the output you should produce from the different solution scripts
you write (i.e., `[title]-soln*.py`).

`pset1.md`: The description of the programming assignment for this
chapter. In CS32, this file becomes `instructions.md` in the `pset1`
Replit project. This copy is done by hand.
